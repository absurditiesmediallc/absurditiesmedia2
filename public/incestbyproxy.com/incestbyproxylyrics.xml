		I was recently priveleged to the secret of success behind our favorite super centre, Wal-Mart.
		In order to prepare employees for price droppings, there is a pre-shift ritual in which the poor, health insuranceless bastards chant in unison near the front of the super centre.
		Not only does this get the workers totally pumped up, it lets the Wal-Mart super centres all over the country say "Thank you America!  
		Thank you for making us your largest corporation by forcing you to give us your money because you can't afford to give it to anyone else,
		and shitting on you if you have no choice but to work at one of our super centres because you can't find another job."
		Now I have never actually seen this ritual take place as I do what I can to avoid the inevitable Wal-Mart super centre around the corner
		(I'll do my shopping at K-Mart, thank you very much), but I urge you all investigate further.
		I'd do it myself, but honestly, I'm terrified that I'll be trampled. 
		May God bless the Republicans.<br/><br/>

		Incest by Proxy is prepared to "dare" one or more of the alleged men who have engaged in homosexual activity with President Bush

		If you have engaged in homosexual activity with President George W. Bush, please describe your encounter in explicit detail and

 		If your story is TRUE, we will send you a copy of "First Blood" and one of our 100% cotton Incest by Proxy T-shirts

      <title> The Reverend's Rantings : A Message to Green Day 10/31/05</title>
      <description>
            <![CDATA[

	   Now that September has ended, I have woken up and its damn near November.  
	   I decided to wait an extra month just to be sure. 
	   I went to sleep hoping that I wouldn't have to hear that fucking song, but low and behold.
	   September has ended and its still there to remind us all that its going to be ok, and we have nothing to worry about.
	   If only I shared the optimism of some so-called punk bitch creating cinematic videos for MTV that remind us all why we strategically place "support our troops" stickers on our SUVs.
	   We must stay the course.
	   If only Green Day would stop, we could put this terrible ordeal behind us.
	   Be safe, and God bless.<br><br>
